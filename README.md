# Converting plain text to html code using django and python

# What is Django
Django is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.
When youâ€™re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.
Django gives you ready-made components to use.

# Prerequisites

#1. The basic syntax of the Python (understanding the indentation if you are coming from other programming languages and new into Python).
Python function. How to pass the argument to the Python function? Setting default value. Getting a list of Python values using *args and **kwargs.

#2. While developing the website you may require multiple Python modules. It depends on the requirement for your website. So the understanding of importing external modules is required.

#3. The website is not just as we see in browsers. There is a ton of coding in the backend to support the website.

#4. Get familiar with the Python control structure. It includes both conditional operators and loops. If you are coming from any other programming language and have basic Python syntax knowledge, it is not a big deal.

#5. No matter what programming language you are learning. The string is one of data structure you should be using in every other line of your project code. Sink yourself and try to check out all the string manipulation operations. It is easy to do that in Python.

#6.You have chosen Django Python framework for your web development. What makes Python different from all other programming language is its prominent data structures like tuple, list (Difference between Python tuple and list), set and dictionary. Understand the structure of data saved in those type of variables. Check out all the functions associated with those data structure. It is fun as the things will start rolling so easily with those data structure variables.

# Requirements
