# Converting plain text to html code using django and python

# What is Django
Django is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.
When youâ€™re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.
Django gives you ready-made components to use.

# Prerequisites

#1. The basic syntax of the Python (understanding the indentation if you are coming from other programming languages and new into Python).
Python function. How to pass the argument to the Python function? Setting default value. Getting a list of Python values using *args and **kwargs.

#2. While developing the website you may require multiple Python modules. It depends on the requirement for your website. So the understanding of importing external modules is required.

#3. The website is not just as we see in browsers. There are tons of data, images or any kind of data which are used in the background. To accessing those data files, you need to have the understanding of Python Path concepts.

#4. Get familiar with the Python control structure. It includes both conditional operators and loops. If you are coming from any other programming language and have basic Python syntax knowledge, it is not a big deal.

#5. No matter what programming language you are learning. The string is one of data structure you should be using in every other line of your project code. Sink yourself and try to check out all the string manipulation operations. It is easy to do that in Python.

#6. There is one more entity called: Regular Expression (RE). The main purpose of RE is to validate the string. For example, if you are asking visitors to input his/her email ID on your website, you have to validate if the string user entered is valid email ID. There is Python module- re for a string validation. Start using and exploring it in your Python code.

#7.You have chosen Django Python framework for your web development. What makes Python different from all other programming language is its prominent data structures like tuple, list (Difference between Python tuple and list), set and dictionary. Understand the structure of data saved in those type of variables. Check out all the functions associated with those data structure. It is fun as the things will start rolling so easily with those data structure variables.

#8. As the projects start looming you need to apply object-oriented concepts. In fact, it is better to drive the object-oriented concepts from the beginning of the development itself. It helps you to bind the similar kind of data (class) and access those data with a single variable called object. You can also reuse the lines of codes if the logic is same. And it reduces line of code, as well as, easy to maintain.
